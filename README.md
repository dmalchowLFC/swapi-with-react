## Summary
This is my second application built using the React framework and my first time implementing an API call to populate the data. The learning curve during this project was a steep one. I learned so much during this project build including: multiple and simultaneous API calls, parsing received data properly, and furthering my knowledge of the React framework. While challenging, I feel like this project help me grow as a developer by a huge margin.
